the last brain cell</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:Courier;font-size:20px;">
the last brain cell is a game I made in around 48 hours for the Unexpected Game Jam. This was my first game jam and at the time of writing this, the submission are still open. The games haven't been rated yet, but frankly speaking I was inspired by the challenge of trying to make a fully playable game within the specified time limit.</br>
</br>
If you are concerned about Rahil's Paradox, don't worry. I am still working on it. In the meantime play the Demo, play the last brain cell. I have put a lot of effort in both games.

The Number Problem</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:Courier;font-size:20px;">
The modern world has become obsessed with numbers -"hey look i have 100 Million followers" we get lost in this number hunting world to the point where people who support us or enjoy our works are treated not as individuals but as Numbers.</br>
</br>
It's obvious but this is a bad practice, our natural ego wants recognition for our work and we validate that with a number...
</br>
</br>
Instead cherish and bond with the people that support you, make content for them, try to bring them joy and make them forget about their troubles, even if it is for a fleeting moment. And know that your work contributes to the whole, even when nobody is watching.

Will he get lucky this time ?</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:Courier;font-size:20px;">
The art of patience is something that is quite weird to understand. There are multiple parallels of the same vision. Either you are waiting for the right time or hey maybe you were a little too patient and the right time just flew by....</br>
</br>
It's hard to get adjusted to this cycle, it's hard to understand when and where you let go and just take a chance. Right time or not you gave it your all, you may fall flat right on your face, but who is stopping you from making a comeback. </br>
</br>
I am worried about the man who tries too much and too hard on every single passion he has... at the end it's always termed a failure.</br>
</br>
An ever aching thought at the back of your mind and a universal question arises ...
</br>
"Should He let it go or will he get lucky this time ?"
