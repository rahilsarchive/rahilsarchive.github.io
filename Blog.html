Video Essays and update on the 3rd game</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:Courier;font-size:20px;">
I had started making Video Essays from January this year to keep me busy and productive at the same time.</br>
I have been uploading them on a semi-regular basis while managing other projects.</br>
In all honesty it's a lot of work, but it's also a lot of fun. So yeah the plan is to make more.</br>
</br>
In regards to the development of my 3rd game, it's going really well.</br>
I will probably reveal something about it around May or June.</br>
This project is extremely special to me and I don't want to rush it.</br>
So till then hope the video essays Keep You Company (Got the reference?) and when the game's ready you'll know about it.

NEW PROJECT / RAHIL'S PARADOX DELAYED</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:courier;font-size:20px;">
I had updated this on the game's official page: Rahil's paradox my first game has been delayed indefinitely.
</br> 
RP was my first project and I had made a lot of mistakes during it's development, now that I am getting better as a programmer and a game developer I want to make sure that the game represents my skill level at the moment, that obviously will take time, but I'm 100% sure you will be able to experience RP again. 
</br> 
I have grown attached with that game and definitely want to make it better before I bring it back.
</br>
</br>
Meanwhile,
</br>
I am working on an entirely different new project.
</br> 
It is a story based narrative driven exploration adventure game that I have been working on for the last few months. 
</br> 
The game has entered into phase 4 of it's development and I still have lot of stuff to work with before it can be released. 
</br>
</br> 
I want to thank everyone for their support, anyone who looks forward to my work and encourages me to do better.

the last brain cell</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:courier;font-size:20px;">
the last brain cell is a game I made in around 48 hours for the Unexpected Game Jam. This was my first game jam and at the time of writing this, the submission are still open. The games haven't been rated yet, but frankly speaking I was inspired by the challenge of trying to make a fully playable game within the specified time limit.</br>
</br>
If you are concerned about Rahil's Paradox, don't worry. I am still working on it. In the meantime play the Demo, play the last brain cell. I have put a lot of effort in both games.

The Number Problem</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:Courier;font-size:20px;">
The modern world has become obsessed with numbers -"hey look i have 100 Million followers" we get lost in this number hunting world to the point where people who support us or enjoy our works are treated not as individuals but as Numbers.</br>
</br>
It's obvious but this is a bad practice, our natural ego wants recognition for our work and we validate that with a number...
</br>
</br>
Instead cherish and bond with the people that support you, make content for them, try to bring them joy and make them forget about their troubles, even if it is for a fleeting moment. And know that your work contributes to the whole, even when nobody is watching.

Will he get lucky this time ?</h2>
<p style="color:rgb(255,255,255);font-family:Courier;font-size:20px;">
The art of patience is something that is quite weird to understand. There are multiple parallels of the same vision. Either you are waiting for the right time or hey maybe you were a little too patient and the right time just flew by....</br>
</br>
It's hard to get adjusted to this cycle, it's hard to understand when and where you let go and just take a chance. Right time or not you gave it your all, you may fall flat right on your face, but who is stopping you from making a comeback. </br>
</br>
I am worried about the man who tries too much and too hard on every single passion he has... at the end it's always termed a failure.</br>
</br>
An ever aching thought at the back of your mind and a universal question arises ...
</br>
"Should He let it go or will he get lucky this time ?"
